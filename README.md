# Elastic_NEST_Painless
Crud capabilities for Elastic using C#, NEST, and the Painless language

This is written in pseudo-code to give a basis in how to setup your datashipper for shipping to the frontend.

The purpose of this code is to help developers who use C#, NEST, and ElasticSearch (Painless language). If the list component within an object runs a separate save to its parent component it catches: create, update, and delete. I know there's not that much documentation out there for NEST and the Painless language, so this code is written as a guide to it.
